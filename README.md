# stLFR_V1.2

Introduction
----------------
Tools of stLFR(Single Tube Long Fragment Reads) data analysis.

stLFR FAQs is directed to MGI_Bioinfor@genomics.cn.

Download source code package from https://github.com/MGI-tech-bioinformatics/stLFR_V1.2.

Updates 
----------------
Jan 10, 2020
1. Updated SV module (SV2.1, https://github.com/MGI-tech-bioinformatics/stLFR_SV2.1_module)
2. Novel summary report of HMTL format.
3. Redesigned pipeline structure and changed some parameters.

May 6, 2019
There are several updates in stLFR_v1.1 comparing with v1:
1. Users could use an alternative reference type (hg19 or hs37d5) in stLFR_v1.1 by --ref option instead of only hg19.
2. Updated CNV and SV detection tools are implied in stLFR_v1.1 for decreasing false discovery rate.
3. Three figures used for illustrating stLFR fragment distribution and coverage are added.
4. NA12878 benchmark VCF by GIAB is used for haplotype phasing error calculation.

Usage
----------------
1. Make sure 'SAMPLELIST' file is in a right format.
2. Run the automatic.

         perl bin/stLFR_SGE -l SAMPLELIST -outputdir OUTPUTDIR
         
3. Or analyze one data in more than one steps:

         # only run fastq filter module first
         perl bin/stLFR_SGE -l SAMPLELIST -outputdir ANALYSIS_FQ -analysis filter
         # do other modules later
         perl bin/stLFR_SGE -l SAMPLELIST -outputdir ANALYSIS_OTHER -analysis align,phase,cnvsv,report -inputdir ANALYSIS_FQ
         

Main progarm arguments:
----------------

   Sample List
   
       -list FILE
                     Name of input file. This is required.

                     Five columns in the list file, which the front three columns are required:
                     1. name    : unique sample ID in this analysis
                     2. path    : fastq path(s) for this sample split with colon(:)
                     3. barcode : sample-barcode for each path split with colon(:), 0 means all used
                     4. reffile : reference with index, two inner options are 'hg19' and 'hs37d5', NULL or '-' means 'hs37d5'
                     5. vcffile : dbsnp file, default is NULL or '-'
                     6. blacklist : black list file(BED format) for SV
                     7. controllist : sorted control list file(BEDPE format) for SV

                     eg:  SAM1   /DATA/slide1/L01                    1-4,5,7-9

   Analysis Modules
   
       -analysis  [ all ]
                     There are 5 modules in this program: filter -> align -> phase -> cnvsv -> report.
                       -analysis all  == -analysis filter,align,phase,cnvsv,report.
                       -analysis base == -analysis filter,align,phase,report.

                     eg: all                : filter + align + phase + cnvsv + report
                         base               : filter + align + phase + report
                         align              : align + report
                         filter,align,phase : filter + align + phase + report

       -inputdir
                     Input directory path with results in previous process. [ ]
                     1. align:  need filter result
                     2. phase:  need align result
                     3. cnvsv:  need align and phase result

   stLFR barcode position
   
       -position [ 101_10,117_10,133_10 ]
                     Position of stLFR barcodes on read2.

   Task Monitor Type
   
       -cpu      [ 60 ]
                     CPU number on server

   Baseline for SNP/INDEL evaluation
   
       -baseline   Baseline VCF for NA12878 on hg19 or hs37d5.
       -confbed    High confidence BED for NA12878 on hg19 or hs37d5.

   Usage
   
       -help       Show brief usage synopsis.
